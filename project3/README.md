=======

The goal is to implement a university database system. There are several kinds of users
-----

1. Students
2. Faculty
3. Staff
4. Executive

Each type of user has different needs and should be allowed to access only data that is appropriate for them.
Some functionality that you should consider including in your system:
------

1. directory lookup
2. course lookup (time & location for a given semester)
3. adding new courses
4. adding grades, changing grades
